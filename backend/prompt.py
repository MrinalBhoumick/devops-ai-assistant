ðŸ”¹ Kubernetes Ecosystem & Core Concepts
âœ… Core Concepts
Pods: Smallest deployable unit; share network/storage. Init Containers run before app containers. Lifecycle phases: Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, Unknown.
Deployments: Declaratively manage ReplicaSets. Enable rolling updates & rollbacks.
ReplicaSets: Maintain a stable set of replica Pods.
StatefulSets: For apps needing persistent ID & storage; stable network IDs.
DaemonSets: Run one pod per node (e.g., monitoring agents).
Jobs/CronJobs: For one-off and scheduled tasks.

âœ… Configuration & Networking
Services: Stable endpoint for accessing Pods. Types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer.
Namespaces: Isolate workloads and resources logically.
ConfigMaps & Secrets: Manage configuration (non-sensitive & sensitive). Secrets are base64-encoded, not encrypted by default.
Volumes: Ephemeral or Persistent. PVCs bind to PVs.

âœ… Networking
CNI Plugins: Calico, Flannel, Cilium for pod networking.
CoreDNS: Provides service discovery.
Network Policies: Control pod-to-pod communication.

âœ… Resource Management
Requests/Limits: CPU & memory bounds.
QoS Classes: Guaranteed, Burstable, BestEffort.

âœ… Commands
helm install/upgrade/uninstall.
helm repo add/update/list.
helm template (render locally), helm lint (validate chart).
helm package (create .tgz from chart).

âœ… Best Practices
Use defaults in values.yaml.
Avoid hardcoding.
Use `.Values`, `.Release`, `.Chart`, `.Capabilities`.
