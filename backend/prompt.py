ðŸ”¹ Kubernetes Ecosystem & Core Concepts
âœ… Core Concepts
Pods: Smallest deployable unit in K8s; one or more containers sharing network/storage.
Deployments: Manage ReplicaSets; enable rolling updates and rollbacks.
ReplicaSets: Ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running.
Services: Stable endpoints for Pods; types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer.
Namespaces: Virtual clusters within a physical cluster; isolate workloads.
ConfigMaps: Store non-sensitive configuration data (env vars, CLI args).
Secrets: Store sensitive data (tokens, passwords) in base64-encoded form.
Volumes: Persistent or ephemeral storage mounted to Pods.
StatefulSets: For stateful apps needing persistent identity and storage.
DaemonSets: Ensure one pod per node (e.g., for log collection).
Jobs/CronJobs: Run one-time or scheduled batch processes.
""",

        "Helm": """
ðŸ”¹ Helm Charts & Packaging
Helm: Kubernetes package manager.
Chart: A collection of YAML files to describe a K8s app.
Templates: Use Go templating to make YAML dynamic.
Commands: helm install, helm upgrade, helm repo add, helm lint, helm package.
Values.yaml: Central config file for parameterization.
Dependencies: Charts can depend on other charts; managed via Chart.yaml.
""",

        "Ingress": """
ðŸ”¹ Ingress Controllers & Load Balancing
Ingress: Manages external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to services.
Ingress Controller: NGINX, Traefik, HAProxyâ€”must be installed separately.
LoadBalancer: Exposes services externally via cloud LB (AWS ELB, etc).
TLS termination and path-based routing done via Ingress.
Annotations: Configure behavior like rewrite-target or rate-limiting.
""",

        "Autoscaling": """
ðŸ”¹ Cluster Autoscaler, Node Affinity, Taints/Tolerations
Cluster Autoscaler: Adds/removes nodes based on pending pods.
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Scales pods based on CPU/memory or custom metrics.
Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA): Adjusts pod resources (CPU/RAM) automatically.
Node Affinity: Assign pods to specific nodes based on labels.
Taints: Prevent scheduling unless toleration is present.
Tolerations: Allow pods to schedule on tainted nodes.
""",

        "RBAC": """
ðŸ”¹ RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
Roles/ClusterRoles: Define permissions (verbs, resources).
RoleBindings/ClusterRoleBindings: Bind roles to users/service accounts.
Namespaces: Roles are namespace-scoped; ClusterRoles are cluster-wide.
ServiceAccounts: Used by pods to authenticate to API server.
""",

        "Security": """
ðŸ”¹ Kubernetes Security Best Practices
Run containers as non-root.
Use read-only file systems where possible.
Limit container capabilities using securityContext.capDrop.
Enable Network Policies to control traffic between pods.
Audit logs: Enable for tracing changes.
Rotate Secrets and TLS certificates regularly.
Use tools like Trivy and kube-bench for scanning.
Restrict API server access and use RBAC.
